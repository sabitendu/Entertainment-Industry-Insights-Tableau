# Entertainment-Industry-Insights-Tableau

## Overview:

As a data analyst at BigScreen Insights, a consultancy specializing in the film sector, I engaged with two extensive datasets: 'Movie Production Details' and 'Movie Revenue and Ratings'. The 'Movie Production Details' dataset furnishes insights into diverse facets of film production, encompassing production companies, budgets, and genres. Conversely, the 'Movie Revenue and Ratings' dataset tracks the commercial performance and audience reception of these films, presenting data on their financial success and public appeal.

Given the substantial impact of box office figures and audience ratings on career trajectories within the industry, the assignment held paramount importance. The primary goal was to explore these datasets, discerning patterns and insights capable of reshaping movie production and marketing strategies. This analytical endeavor sought not only to benefit BigScreen Insights but also to offer valuable guidance to clients operating within the film industry.

## Objective:

Our objective was to harness Tableau's powerful features to construct a compelling narrative using the provided datasets. This endeavor encompassed meticulous data preparation, strategic data modeling, and adept utilization of calculated fields and Tableau functions for advanced analysis. The overarching aim was to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard within Tableau, highlighting significant findings and delivering succinct, actionable insights to refine movie production and marketing strategies.

## Steps Involved:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Tableau file using tableau Public/Desktop.
3. Connect the dashboard to the provided datasets ('Movie Revenue and Ratings' and 'Moive Production Details').
4. Refresh the data to update the dashboard with the latest insights.
5. Explore the various visualizations and filters to gain insights into e-commerce performance.

## Key Insights From Dashboard:

* Genre Analysis:

Among the most watched genres, Science Fiction, Action, and Comedy stand out, each contributing between 16.6% and 17.3% of the movies viewed. Conversely, Thriller and Documentaries emerge as the least favored genres, with each accounting for 16.4% of the movies watched.

* Revenue Trends Over Years:

Global box office revenue has exhibited a consistent upward trajectory over time, albeit with occasional fluctuations. However, a notable decline occurred in 2020, likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. While revenue began to rebound in 2021, it has yet to surpass pre-pandemic levels.

* Country-based Movie Productions:

In the realm of movie production, the USA and France emerge as dominant forces in the Action genre, while France and Germany lead in Comedy productions. Canada and France take the helm in Documentary creations, and Australia and Canada shine in the Drama genre. For Sci-Fi films, the USA and Canada lead the charge, with Germany and the USA prominent in Thriller productions.

* Calculations for ROI Analysis:

When considering Return on Investment (ROI), Documentary movies prove to be the most lucrative, closely followed by Thriller and Action genres, whereas Sci-Fi films yield the lowest ROI. Among the analyzed countries, Canada and Australia boast the highest ROI, trailed by the USA and France. Conversely, Japan exhibits the lowest ROI among the seven countries examined.
